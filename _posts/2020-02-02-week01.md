# Why I Decided To Take A Course In Open Source Development  

For the past few months, I have been working as a Software Engineering  
Intern at a startup. One of the most important and indispensable tools  
that I have needed to utilize time after time is the renowned version-control  
system called git. Git is a wonderful tool that helps software teams manage  
modifications to their source code over time. One way in which it accomplishes  
this is by meticulously keeping track of every single modification that an  
engineer may make to a codebase. There are definitely more features that git  
provides that make managing an entire codebase easy; however, for the sake of  
this post, I will refrain from listing all of them. With all of that in mind,  
before taking this course, I was informed by a great number of my peers that this  
course dives a lot into git and it's underlying features and functionalities. This  
very nugget of information pique a lot of interest in me for many reasons. As  
a Software Engineering Intern, I use git a lot and have come to understand how to  
use some of it's main features, and though I have been using git for many months now,  
I still feel as though I don't have a very deep and extensive understanding of how  
it works as a whole. I understand the basic functionalities such as commits, pushing,  
pulling, merging, along with other operations and what they do, but I simply feel as  
though I don't possess the advanced knowledge of just how these operations and git  
thereof work as a whole underneath the "hood". How do these commands do what they're  
supposed to do? How was git designed or how would one even go about designing such a tool?  
It's one thing to know how to use a tool, but it's another to understand how such a tool was  
constructed as well as it's underlying features and limitations. I believe that knowing  
such things would certainly help me to become both a better Software Engineer and an expert  
with git. Hearing that this course teaches a lot about git coupled with my desire to know  
more about it on a deeper level, caused me to want to take this course. As a result, I  
decided to, and am very much looking forward to learning more about git and other topics  
such as Open Source Development in the upcoming weeks!  

Happy Coding,
