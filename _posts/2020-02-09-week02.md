# Blog Prompt for Week 2

### Various Ways I Would Like to Contribute to one or more open source projects during the course of this semester:
1. Creating diagrams, screen-shots, and graphics for other people's docs to help enhance them.
2. Submitting changes to an Open Source project and having them be successfully merged into the designated codebase.
3. Designing a documentation guide on the architecture of a project as a means to help others including myself navigate proficiently through the project.
4. Analyzing and reviewing an Open Source Project's documentation and correcting any spelling or grammar mistakes that may be present.
5. Cloning Open Source Projects onto my device, thoroughly testing them, and submitting bug reports that contain a list of all of the current bugs that may have been found during testing.
6. Suggesting new features and options to the project or even new graphics such as icons and backgrounds that would help enhance the program.
7. Help others learn how to use the program by doing things such as building a glossary of technical terms that are associated with the project's technologies or even creating simple tutorials that help others become more familiar with the project.
8. Reading relevant standards and checking to see if the codebase follows those standards.
9. Translating documentation or any program text to another language such as Spanish for other contributors that may only know Spanish.
10. Contribute to an Open Source Project and then convincing others to also contribute to that same project to help them out even further.
