# Blog for Week 4  
## Open Source Projects That I Have Looked At Thus Far:
### Google's Open Source UI Software Development Kit: Flutter
#### Project Documents
* Contains a README.md, CONTRIBUTING.md, CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md, and a LICENSE file.
* All of these files are very complete and concise. Very easy for newbies to follow and get started quickly!
#### Project Tools and Technology
* Issue Tracker: Github Issue Tracker
* Communication Channel(s): Discord and Github
* Programming Languages and Tools:  Dart
* Development Environment: Android Studio with the Flutter Plugin
#### Project Activity
* Community Staus: Extremely Active
* Issues/Pull requests: A lot of issues and pull requests
* Questions/Reponses: Lots of questions, but many replies to those questions
#### Issue Tracking
* Issue Tagging: Issues are both thoroughly tracked and have the appropriate tags.
* Issues For Newcomers: There is a section for new contributors that show how to contribute to Flutter, but there isn't many tasks in that section.
#### Community Responsiveness
* Merged Pull Requests: Pull requests are reviewed very quickly, but it seems as though many don't get merged as fast because the Flutter team requires high degree of excellence.
* Questions About Issues: Answered almost always on the same day!
#### Community Welcomeness
* Community Feel: Very warming!
* Newcomer-Friendly: Docs are both newcomer-friendly and well documented.
* Project Conduct: Flutter's and other contributor's conduct is very helpful to other contributors and also very respectful.

**Concluding Project Evaluation**: All in all, Flutter is a very promising Open Source project that I would very much be interested in contributing to. Their repository has everything that would make it extremely easy for newcomers to get started with it. The only lacking quality about their repo is that they just don't have many tasks for new contributors, but everything else about the repository and project is great!

### Microsoft's Cross-Platform Source-Code Editor: Visual Studio Code
#### Project Documents
* Contains a README.md, CONTRIBUTING.md, and a LICENSE file. No Code of Conduct file located in the repo, but rather a link to a section on Microsoft's website that talks in detail about the Microsoft Open Source Code of Conduct.
* All of these files are very complete and concise. Very easy for newbies to follow and get started quickly!
#### Project Tools and Technology
* Issue Tracker: Github Issue Tracker
* Communication Channel(s): Stack Overflow (vscode tag) and Github
* Programming Languages and Tools: TypeScript, Javascript, CSS
* Development Environment: Local Development Version of VS Code and the Chrome Developer Tools
#### Project Activity
* Community Staus: Extremely Active
* Issues/Pull requests: A lot of issues and pull requests
* Questions/Reponses: Not many questions, but when there are very quick replies and answers from the community.
#### Issue Tracking
* Issue Tagging: Issues are both thoroughly tracked and have the appropriate tags.
* Issues For Newcomers: No section for newcomers. A very miniscule amount of issues for beginners. A few tags titled "good first issues".
#### Community Responsiveness
* Merged Pull Requests: Pull requests are reviewed very quickly and a lot of them seem to get merged as well.
* Questions About Issues: Answered on the exact same day within a few hours.
#### Community Welcomeness
* Community Feel: Somewhat warming!
* Newcomer-Friendly: Docs are very well documented, but not so much incentive for newcomers.
* Project Conduct: The VS Code Team's and other contributor's conduct is very helpful to other contributors and also very respectful.

**Concluding Project Evaluation**: All in all, Visual Studio Code is a somewhat promising Open Source project that I would be interested in contributing to. Their repository has a lot of resources that would make it easy to understand their project's workflow and setup the environment quickly, but there isn't as many tasks for newcomers that one would expect for a project of this magnitude which might scare many away. Other than this, the Visual Studio Code community has a high responsiveness rate for this project, and the community also seems to move very fast when it comes to solving issues.

### go-git: a highly extensible git implementation in pure Go
#### Project Documents
* Contains a README.md, CONTRIBUTING.md, CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md, and a LICENSE file.
* All of the files are very complete and concise. The README is somewhat not clear in some aspects, but everything else is.
#### Project Tools and Technology
* Issue Tracker: Github Issue Tracker
* Communication Channel(s): Stack Overflow (go-git tag), Github, Slack (#go-git room)
* Programming Languages and Tools: Go, Git
* Development Environment: Git (Not clearly stated in repo)
#### Project Activity
* Community Staus: Somewhat Active
* Issues/Pull requests: A lot of issues, but few pull requests
* Questions/Reponses: Not many questions at all, and no replies for weeks for some pull requests.
#### Issue Tracking
* Issue Tagging: Issues are decently tracked and have their appropritate tags.
* Issues For Newcomers: Only one issue currently for newcomers!!
#### Community Responsiveness
* Merged Pull Requests: Pull requests are not reviewed very quickly and only about 50% of them seemed to get merged.
* Questions About Issues: Answered weeks after they were asked!
#### Community Welcomeness
* Community Feel: Somewhat warming
* Newcomer-Friendly: Docs are not very documented, and also not much incentive for newcomers.
* Project Conduct: The  conduct displayed is somewhat helpful to other contributors, but very very respectful though.

**Concluding Project Evaluation**: All in all, go-git is an extremely interesting Open Source project, but not one that I would be super interested in contributing to. The community is somewhat active. There's also not much incentive for newcomers to contribute to the project as there was only one issue listed as a "good first issue". Along with all of this, the responsiveness from the go-git team doesn't seem to be all that high as many questions that were asked to the team were answered weeks after the question posting. This project would probably be one that I would most likely eliminate from my list of Open Source projects that I very much like to contribute to.
