# Top Open Source Project Preferences

1. OpenStreetMap:
The OpenStreetMap Open Source project tops my preferences lists simply because 




2. Microsoft's Visual Studio Code:
The Visual Studio Code project is one in which I would very much like to work on. As a text editor, Visual Studio Code is my absolute favorite text editor and I use it almost every single day. The application is super neat and well organized, comes with tons of different color themes, and allows users to begin coding very quickly. As an application for software engineers and programmers, Visual Studio Code is absolutely wonderful, but even as an Open Source project it is fantastic for Open Source contributors. As an Open Source project, Visual Studio Code is well documented, has a very active community, and an easy to understand project workflow. The Visual Studio Code community is very welcoming to new contributors, the conduct displayed by the Visual Studio Code team is extremely professional, and there is an immense community responsiveness to the project by the contributors who are maintaining the project. People who contribute to the project can contribute knowing that the Visual Studio Code team reviews pull requests and answers questions concerning issues very quickly. The project also uses many relevant and popular programming technologies such as TypeScript, Javascript, and CSS so the knowledge/experience obtained by using these skills while contributing to this project will definitely be transferrable for other Open Source projects and other programming endeavors. The Visual Studio Code Open Source project has too many great things going for it and because of this, it makes my Open Source top project preferences list!
