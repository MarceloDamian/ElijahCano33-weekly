# Gatsby Chronicles

### Overview:
The open source project that me and my group have selected to make contributions to over the course of the semester is Gatsby.js, a free and open source framework based on React that helps developers build blazing fast websites and apps. I was really interested in working on this project because during my evaluation of this organization, I noticed that that they have a high community responsivess, their docs are very well documented and easy for beginners to pick up, tons of tags that are both labeled and very detailed, and the Gatsby team was also seen to be very friendly and helpful to people contributing to their project!

I did some research on this exact issue and based on my findings, this issue seemed to be occurring because my current version of yarn was slightly too old. After that, I ran into some problems with upgrading yarn that originated from npm on my device since I used npm to install yarn initially. More and more problems kept on appearing so this slowed down my progress. Ultimately, I was able to upgrade yarn, but then when running the command "yarn test" again I ran into a new issue.


### Gatsby Issue Logs:
During my installation of the Gatsby project, I looked over the list of the project's issues on their github page. The Gatsby repo does have issues that are specifically marked for beginners, but most of them are already taken and being worked on by other contributors. The ones
