# Open Source is About Us As a Community:

My initial thoughts concerning the article "Open Source is Not About You" are that though the tone is very firm, I do agree with the author's overall message about open source development. People who use any sort of open source product shouldn't in any shape or form feel as though they are entitled to anything. They don't have the right to tell the owner's or people that produce those open source products what they should be doing or how they should be managing their projects or products. If the user has an issue, they shouldn't be complaining instead they should either fix it themselves or create their own solution that solves the problem they're complaining about. As people who use open source products, we shouldn't feel any sense of entitlement instead we should be giving back to one another, helping eachother, and expressing our thankfulness to the people that have made these projects and products. As seen in the article, many of the people that creating these projects and products are investing both a lot of their time and money into them, and for some people to not truly appreciate this and then feel as though they are entitled to something and expect that these people do what they want is something that is not so wrong. Open source shouldn't be something that we take for granted because it's ultimately a blessing that many people have fought for. Instead we should appreciate this wondeful thing that we have, and help out those that are putting their heart and soul into these open source projects and products. Open source is about all of us as a community!
