# Coronavirus Impact:
Initially, I didn't give much thought to the pandemic otherwise known as the Coronavirus. I thought that this would be another disease epidemic that would just passed away after a few months like other ones that have previously had their fair share of inflicting terror, pain, and destruction; however, that is most certainly not the case with this one. Before I knew it, the Coronavirus had made its way into New York City. It only took a matter of days for many businesses, schools, and other public facilities to either be shut down or closed. What appeared to be such a wonderful semester quickly turned into one with tons of confusion, uneasiness, and uncertainty. When I first received the news that classes at Hunter College were no longer going to be held physically, but rather virtually, I began questioning how I would be able to handle the issue of not having quick access to some sort of internet connection as at home, I do not at all have internet or any sort of cable. Because of this, I usually rely on school to be open so that I can take advantage of the free wifi that the university offers. For this reason, I almost never do homework at home, but rather at school or at the library that's close to my house. I also began wondering how would this transition to remote learning affect the way I take exams and do other school related activities. Many professors were also wondering how they would conduct such activities and were unsure as well of the implications that remote classes would impose on the learning environment. We're all unsure on what the future holds and whether or not all of this will work and be somewhat successful. For this reason, I think many people have come to develop a level of uneasiness about everything that's occurring within our society. I am a person that is rarely at home; however, with the illness outside I have made the decision to stay home and only go out to buy food or other materials for my house. It has felt very weird to just be home and I quickly find myself getting bored easily whenever I am not doing work. On another note, one of my friends recently notified me about Spectrum's Free Student Internet Service. It's a service that Spectrum is providing to students who due to the Coronavirus who must stay at home, and who also do not have access to wifi. Upon hearing the news I immediately called Spectrum and within a day they sent me a free wifi modem and route for sixty days. I am thankful for the service that they are providing and hope that this situation won't continue to persist even after the semester is over. Unfortunately, I believe that the worst is yet to come and that all of us will be forced to stay self-quarantined until maybe mid-summer. In New York City, I don't believe a curfew will be put in place, but I do think that more businesses and restaurants will continue to close down as they lose tons of money to losing so many customers. I also believe that in some supermarkets we may see supply continue to decrease as the illness spreads and the number of people getting sick with it increases which could have so many ripple effects. I hope this won't be the case, but it most likely will be for about the next three months. All in all, I wish well-being to all!
