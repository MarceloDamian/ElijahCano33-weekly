# Gatsby Chronicles: :tada:

Finally, after many frustrating weeks of attempting to build and run the Gatsby docs locally, I have indeed succeeded. Right before the last blog, I submmited a [bug report](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/issues/22649) to the Gatsby team in hopes that they could assist me in finding a solution to a problem I was having when trying to run the Gatsby docs. This problem was concerned with the screenshot process :camera_flash: taking an irrational amount of time and never ending during the Gatsby docs build.  About more than a week after posting the issue, Gatsby members proposed a few solutions and one of them did in fact end up working for me. The solution that worked for me was creating a new file inside the www directory that's within their Gatsby project files with a specific command listed inside it that intentionally skips the screenshot process :camera_flash: during the building of the Gatsby docs.

With the Gatsby docs building and running successfully on my machine, I decided to get to work immediately on the particular issue that I had selected to work on.
