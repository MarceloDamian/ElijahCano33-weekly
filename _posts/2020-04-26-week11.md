# Gatsby Contribution Merge & Gatsby Maintainer: :star:

This past week was very rewarding and exciting because my documentation contributions were officially merged:exclamation: It took a few days because the Gatsby maintainer that was reviewing the pull request I had submitted suggested for me to commit a few changes. My initial changes weren't passing all the require tests that the Gatsby team put in place; however, after a few commits, my changes were indeed passing all the necessary tests that they needed to in order to be merged into master. Before I knew it, my pull request was merged :trumpet:! Surprisingly, another exciting thing happened right after that-that I was not at all expecting which was that I was given an invitation to become a Gatsby maintainer. I was extremely stoked to have been granted the opportunity to become a Gatsby maintainer and immediately accepted it. It may not be a big deal to many, but to me it is because I have the utmost respect for the Gatsby team and for the wonderful software product that they are most well known for which is Gatsby.js. I deeply appreciate all they are doing for the open source community and would love the opportunity to be a maintainer and continue to help contribute to their project and all the amazing work that they are doing there.
