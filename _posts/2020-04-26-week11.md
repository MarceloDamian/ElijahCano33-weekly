# Gatsby Contribution Merge & Gatsby Maintainer: :star:

This past week was very rewarding and exciting because my documentation contributions were officially merged:exclamation: It took a few days because the Gatsby maintainer that was reviewing the pull request I had submitted suggested for me to commit a few changes. My initial changes weren't passing all the require tests that the Gatsby team put in place; however, after a few commits, my changes were indeed passing all the necessary tests that they needed to in order to be merged into master. Before I knew it, my pull request was merged :trumpet:! Surprisingly, another exciting thing happened right after that-that I was not at all expecting which was that I was given an invitation to become a Gatsby maintainer :tada:. I was extremely stoked to have been granted the wonderful opportunity to become a Gatsby maintainer and immediately accepted it. It may not be a big deal to many, but to me it is because I have the utmost respect for the Gatsby team and for the incredible software product that they are most well known for which is Gatsby.js. I deeply appreciate all that they are doing for the open source community and would love the opportunity to be a maintainer and continue to help contribute to their project.

With my changes and pull request merged, I have been looking into other issues that I can pick and help contribute to. Many issues I have looked into are already taken, but I did see two that weren't or still need some other people to help contribute to. The first being this [TypeScript migration issue](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/issues/21995). The Gatsby team has been rewriting their core codebase in TypeScript and are looking for people to help them. They have been listing certain files and asking people to comment which ones they would like to jump into and add the proper typings. I really like this issue because it would massively help with getting more familiar with their codebase and also because it would be a coding contribution which would be fantastic for me since I absolutely love coding. The only caveat with this issue though, is that I don't know very much about TypeScript. Because I have little to no experience with TypeScript, it would also probably take longer for me to contribute since there would have to be a lot of learning on my end. I am not sure whether I would be able to produce the quality TypeScript code that they are looking for their codebase with barely any TypeScript experience.

Another issue that also interests me a lot is a Gatsby documentation issue that's concerned with their Node APIs docs. The [issue](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/issues/12665) is asking for someone to add further context about each Node API such as the parameters it requires as well as give an example on how to use it. This is also another high impact issue, and I would very much like to work on it. The only thing holding me back is that because I don't have so much experience using these APIs, I am unsure if I would be able to provide the deep and intricate explanations and examples to these APIs that they are looking for. Nevertheless, I am strongly leaning towards this issue and will most likely select it as my next issue :heavy_check_mark:.
