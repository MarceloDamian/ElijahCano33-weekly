|---|:---|:---|:---|
|   3    |  [link to first OpenStreetMap contribution](https://www.openstreetmap.org/changeset/81082711)   |  OpenStreet Map feature   |   I got rid of the pizza point icon for Pastafina, a pizzaria place that used to be located on 876 Lexington Ave. I removed the point icon because the business is no longer in service as it was closed down a few months ago.   |
|  3   |  [link to second OpenStreetMap contribution](https://www.openstreetmap.org/changeset/81083091)   |  OpenStreet Map feature   |   I added a new supermarket point icon, marked the location with it's appropiate name: "Fine Fare Supermarket", and finally listed the correct address for the supermarket.   |
