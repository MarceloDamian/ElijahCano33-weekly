|   3    |  [link to first OpenStreetMap contribution](https://www.openstreetmap.org/changeset/81082711)   |  OpenStreet Map feature   |   I got rid of the pizza point icon for Pastafina, a pizzaria place that used to be located on 876 Lexington Ave. I removed the point icon because the business is no longer in service as it was closed down a few months ago.   |

| 6|[link to blog edit change that I made to Denice's weekly blog](https://github.com/hunter-college-ossd-spr-2020/deniceysv-weekly/pull/2)| Blog Edit | I lowercased all instances of the words "Open Source" that weren't at the start of a sentence in Denice's week 2 and 5 blogs.|
